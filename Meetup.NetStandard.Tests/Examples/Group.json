Our aim is to build a local community of technical people in and around Nottingham working to share ideas, get better at what they do and improve Nottingham as a place to work in the tech industry. <br> <br> We welcome people at all levels and from all backgrounds; if you're interested in technology, we're interested in you. <br> <br> There's usually free drinks and food for attendees, and always an interesting talk, so come along - everybody's nice.&nbsp;</p>",
